Psuedo-code / process:

1. Pass in configuration specifying how to train each model and how to run AL
2. Select seed set (require an indices file for max reproducibility)
3. Form train / val / test (val and test are constant, train is the seed set)
4. Train model
5. Use trained model on non-seed set (unlabeled pool) and select what to send to oracle. Update seed set and repeat 3-4.

How do we specify that a given dataset has only limited access? We pass it indices, which further restrict it.
    -> We just have to subset the original dataset.

What settings would we want control of? 
    - seed_size
    - num_al_cycles
    - new_labels_per_cycle
    - al_strategy
